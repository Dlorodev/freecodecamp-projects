            <h4>What is Java?</h4>
            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
                that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
                that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The
                syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java
                runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
                typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
                programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with
                a reported 9 million developers.</p>
            <p>It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.</p>
            <p>It is used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile applications (specially Android apps)</li>
                <li>Desktop applications</li>
                <li>Web applications</li>
                <li>Web servers and application servers</li>
                <li>Games</li>
                <li>Database connection</li>
                <li>And much, much more!</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Why use Java?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)</li>
                <li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world</li>
                <li>It has a large demand in the current job market</li>
                <li>It is easy to learn and simple to use</li>
                <li>It is open-source and free</li>
                <li>It is secure, fast and powerful</li>
                <li>It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)</li>
                <li>Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
                    reused, lowering development costs</li>
                <li>As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Java Install</h4>
            <p>Some PCs might have Java already installed.</p>
            <p>To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the
                following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):</p>
            <code>C:\Users\Your Name>java -version</code>
            <p>If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):</p>
            <code>java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS<br>
            Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)<br>
            Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)</code>
            <p>If you do not have Java installed on your computer, you can download it for free at oracle.com.</p>
            <h4>Setup for Windows</h4>
            <p>To install Java on Windows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to "System Properties" (Can be found on Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced
                    System Settings)</li>
                <li>Click on the "Environment variables" button under the "Advanced" tab</li>
                <li>Then, select the "Path" variable in System variables and click on the "Edit" button</li>
                <li>Click on the "New" button and add the path where Java is installed, followed by \bin. By default,
                    Java is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1 (If nothing else was specified when you
                    installed it). In that case, You will have to add a new path with: C:\Program
                    Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin
                    Then, click "OK", and save the settings</li>
                <li>At last, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and type java -version to see if Java is running on your
                    machine</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="Java_Syntax" class="main-section">
            <header>Java Syntax</header>
            <p>In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Main.java, and we used the following code to print
                "Hello World" to the screen:</p>
            <code>public class Main {<br>
            public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
            System.out.println("Hello World");}<br>
            }</code>
            <h4>Exapmle Explained</h4>
            <p>Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class
                <strong>Main</strong>. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.</p>
            <p>The name of the java file <strong>must match</strong> the class name. When saving the file, save it using
                the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer,
                make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java. The
                output should be:</p>
            <code>Hello World</code>
            <h4>The main Method</h4>
            <p>The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:</p>
            <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>
            <p>Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after main.
                You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.</p>
            <p>For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that
                every program must contain the main() method.</p>
            <h4>System.out.println()</h4>
            <p>Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:</p>
            <code>public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
            System.out.println("Hello World");}</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Java_Output" class="main-section">
            <header>Java Output</header>
            <h4>Print Text</h4>
            <p>You learned from the previous chapter that you can use the println() method to output values or print
                text in Java:</p>
            <code>System.out.println("Hello World!");</code>
            <p>You can add as many println() methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method:</p>
            <code>System.out.println("Hello World!");<br>
            System.out.println("I am learning Java.");<br>
            System.out.println("It is awesome!");</code>
            <h4>Double Quotes</h4>
            <p>When you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".</p>
            <p>If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:</p>
            <code>System.out.println("This sentence will work!");<br>
            System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);</code>
            <h4>The Print() Method</h4>
            <p>There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().</p>
            <p>The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:</p>
            <code>System.out.print("Hello World! ");<br>
            System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Java_Comments" class="main-section">
            <header>Java Comments</header>
            <p>Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent
                execution when testing alternative code.</p>
            <h4>Single-line Comments</h4>
            <p>Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).</p>
            <p>Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).</p>
            <p>This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:</p>
            <code>// This is a comment<br>
            System.out.println("Hello World");</code>
            <h4>Java Multi-line Comments</h4>
            <p>Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.</p>
            <p>Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.</p>
            <p>This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:</p>
            <code>/* The code below will print the words Hello World<br>
            to the screen, and it is amazing */<br>
            System.out.println("Hello World");</code>
